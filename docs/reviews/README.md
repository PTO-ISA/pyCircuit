# Modernization Reviews

This directory stores independent design, code, architecture-conformance, and
integration reviews for the modernization program. Review independence and
acceptance rules are defined in
[Project Governance](../development/project-governance.md).

Name a review `<candidate>-<review-kind>.md` and record:

- proposal or candidate path and SHA-256;
- date, logical role, actual model, effort, and reviewer independence;
- scope and evidence examined;
- verdict: `approval-ready`, `revise`, `blocked`, or `accepted` as applicable;
- findings, disposition, residual risks, and invalidation conditions.

An `approval-ready` design review is permission to request the user's precise
approval. It is not approval of the interface or authorization to implement it.
