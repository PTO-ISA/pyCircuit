# TMU.TUL.REN — Rename

- Source candidate: `DAV-TMU-TUL-REN-0001`
- Hardware hierarchy: **H3**, within H1 `TMU` / H2 `TUL`
- NDF refinement: **L2 microarchitecture**; module-specific L1 behavior links still require review.
- Recommended disposition: **alias** (proposal, not registry approval)
- Implementation placement: use the accepted containing owner or contract file under `designs/davincioo/`; no independent leaf is authorized by this inventory disposition.
- Current design-program execution status: **not implemented**. External source evidence is recorded separately.

Normative candidate is deprecated migration provenance; scalar T/U rename belongs to SPE.OOO.REN/MPQ and is not a TMU leaf.

## Inputs

No independent ports: this work item is contained state or a migration alias. Resolve its containing owner; do not allocate another Queue/state owner.

## Outputs

No independent ports: this work item is contained state or a migration alias. Resolve its containing owner; do not allocate another Queue/state owner.

Payload names in proposed rows are design pseudotypes until fields, widths and nominal identity are frozen. Queue transport is inferred by the compiler, not a requested public Queue wrapper. Clock/reset/time domain are execution context and must not be invented as ordinary payload ports.

## Owned or containing state

- No additional item recorded; exact state/port review remains required.

## Required capabilities to verify

- No additional item recorded; exact state/port review remains required.

These are requirements, not proof that the current framework is missing each one. First test the current revision; a demonstrated gap becomes a generic framework/primitive issue and regression before a dependent design PR.

## Behavioral acceptance

- No TMU source registration
- No duplicate scalar map/free/history state
- Migration preserves audit linkage only

gfsim execution is the first implementation gate. PYC/RTL obligations apply to the admitted lowering and remain explicit future work where provisional storage is rejected. Compile-only evidence does not establish behavior.

## Open decisions

- Close DAV-OQ-OOO-0001 and record final alias/deprecation disposition.

## Contributor closure

- [ ] Claim the candidate and identify its parent/containing state owner.
- [ ] Resolve disposition; aliases and contained state must not duplicate hardware.
- [ ] Link the relevant NDF L0 intent and L1 behavior to this L2 implementation.
- [ ] Freeze port payload fields/widths, producer/consumer, parent seam, state/reset and timing profile.
- [ ] Define functional branches, all-or-none effects, contention and cancel/recovery lifecycle.
- [ ] Link a minimal failing gate for each actual framework/primitive gap and merge that shared fix first.
- [ ] Implement the accepted owner and design-local expected-result tests.
- [ ] Prove backpressure, identity/generation, exactly-once effects and isolated instances in gfsim.
- [ ] Integrate into H2/H1 and record admitted PYC/RTL evidence or remaining boundary.

## Source evidence

- `docs/specification/davincioo/ndf-next/tile/tmu.md:61` — Deprecated boundary; SPE.OOO REN/MPQ/CMT/FLS and BROB are selected owners.

Source paths use the frozen external repository spelling, including legacy `l3/` directories; they are provenance, not the new hierarchy vocabulary. File hashes and the original catalog disposition are in [catalog.json](../../catalog.json). See [architecture](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) for unresolved global decisions.
